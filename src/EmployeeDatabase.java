 * Assignment 7 Question 1
 * 
 *  Project Specs:
 *  This assignment will use the Employee class that you developed for assignment 6. Design two sub- classes of 
 *  Employee...SalariedEmployee and HourlyEmployee. A salaried employee has an annual salary attribute. An 
 *  hourly employee has an hourly pay rate attribute, an hours worked attribute, and an earnings attribute. An
 *  hourly employee that works more than 40 hours gets paid at 1.5 times their hourly pay rate. You will decide 
 *  how to implement constructors, getters, setters, and any other methods that might be necessary.
 *  
 *  Project Deliverables:
 *  1. Implement the classes, and write a test program that creates:
 *  			One salaried employee
 *  			One of the hourly employees should have hours worked set to less than 40.
 *  			One should have hours worked set to more than 40. 
 *  2. The test program should display all attributes for the three employees. 
 *  			To keep things simple, the employee classes donâ€™t need to do any editing.

 * Here I will set up my old employee class to use.

/*
 * Here is the main class that will have all of the project's logic and major control flow.
